# BBC Air-Quality Test Solution
This code base is my developed solution to the bbc-airquality task.
The built code base can be found in the dist folder after running the build commands.

## Getting started

To start the project follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the code. Open your terminal where the code is located and run:

```bash
npm install
```

2. To start the code in your browser run:

```bash
npm start
```
_Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) with your browser to see the result._

3. To build a reusable dist folder.

```bash
npm run build
```
If you are using powershell as your terminal of choice then run this instead.

```bash
npm run build-powershell
```

4. To serve the built folder.

```bash
npm run serve
```
Open [http://localhost:51422](http://localhost:3010) with your browser to see the result. If this doesn't work then use the url link provided in your terminal.
